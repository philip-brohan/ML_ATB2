Script to convert all the benchmark examples to tf.tensors
==========================================================

Convert all the images (note that this script does not run the conversion - it outputs a list of commands to be run - run those efficiently in parallel).

.. literalinclude:: ../../make_data/all_images_to_tensor.py

Convert all the number arrays (note that this script does not run the conversion - it outputs a list of commands to be run - run those efficiently in parallel).

.. literalinclude:: ../../make_data/all_numbers_to_tensor.py
